Day 1:

1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP1.1 HTTP2

The textual format is where it functions

best. It uses the binary protocol to operate

All requests that come after it are blocked

by head of line blocking until it runs out

of resources. Since many requests can be multiplexed, only one TCP connection is needed.

It makes use of resource inlining requests

to obtain several pages. It uses PUSH to collect all multiple pages from each server, frame by frame.

It does data compression on its own. It compresses data using HPACK.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

A JavaScript object is a distinct entity with properties and a type. Consider the analogy of a cup. A cup has distinct properties. The design, weight, color, and material of a cup are among its other distinguishing features. Similarly, JavaScript objects can contain properties that define their attributes.

Object Creation in JavaScript:

· By object literal

Syntax:

Object={Propertity1:value1,Property2:value2,PropertyN:ValueN};

Example:

var car={name:”BMW”,colour:”Red”};

· By explicitly generating instances of Object using new keyword

Syntax:

var object=new object();

Example:

var person=new person();

person.name=”jhon”;

person.age=24;
